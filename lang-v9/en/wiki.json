Since ghosts can roam out of their rooms, they can hunt from anywhere the roam takes them. As far as temperatures go, the temps will drop in any room that the ghost has spent time in, which can be the result of roaming frequently or stalking behavior (Banshee).

Note: It queues the hunt after the 3rd blowout but if it can't initiate it (because of an existing hunt or a cooldown) then it will get delayed (after the cooldown smudge timers also delay the hunt) and any candles blown during that time won't count towards the cycle (as the counter will only get reset at the start of the ability hunt).",

    "{{wiki_misconceptions_mimic_2_r}}": "There is 0 evidence in 0 evidence games.

For higher difficulties that start with the breaker off or broken, you will be able to see your breath in every room inside the map. This can make it difficult to locate the ghost's current room as it masks a strong indicator of the ghost having dropped the temperature in their immediate area.",
